<p>Flickr offically announced the <a href="http://i-5-m.net/post/109152983">short-url thing</a>, along with a way to easily post these to flickr. See also the <a href="http://code.flickr.com/blog/2009/06/30/twitter-in-the-api/">code blog post</a>.</p>&#13;
<p><br />I still wish there was a way to grab the short-url from the Share This button on the photo page.</p>
