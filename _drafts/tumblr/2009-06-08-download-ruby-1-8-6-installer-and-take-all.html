<p>Maybe slightly abusing the Quote style post on Tumblr, but installing recent Ruby versions on Windows and OSX should be a lot easier than it is.</p>&#13;
<p>On Windows, I'd had Ruby 1.8.6 installed from the <a href="http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?RubyInstaller">One Click installer</a>, but decided to upgrade to the 1.9.1 binary because I'm primarily using it for writing Shoes programmes, and <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.shoes/3589">Shoes 3 is moving to Ruby 1.9.1</a> so it makes sense to keep my system Ruby the same. Unfortunately the 1.9.1 binary is missing all the dlls that come with the One Click installer (that's now one and a half year's old!). Hence solution quoted above; you don't need to run the One Click installer, just use something like <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> to open the installer up and pull the dlls out.</p>&#13;
<p>On OSX I haven't even bothered to upgrade my Ruby install. <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> is probably the best way, but I have Macports and Xcode on an external hard drive to save space (And it was outragouely hard to get Macports setup that way), so that doesn't help a great deal when it comes to installing Ruby from it. And being able to install from source by hand is nice, but you really shouldn't have to <a href="http://danbenjamin.com/articles/2008/02/ruby-rails-leopard">go to these lengths</a> to use a more recent version of Ruby  on OSX.</p>&#13;
<p>Ruby is a lovely language, but it sometimes gives the impression of being too 'cool' for it's own good.  Mind you, Python (on OSX) <a href="http://trac.macports.org/wiki/FAQ">doesn't seem that much better</a>.</p>
