> All accounts now have unlimited private and public repositories with unlimited storage. You can now get a 5-user private code repository account for free… forever

I'm an entrenched [Github](http://github.com) user now, using the Micro plan, mainly because it has always *just worked* for me from behind a corporate firewall. I tried [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) and [Codaset](http://codaset.com/) out when I was trying to pick someone to use, and it's all very well having free plans that give you private repositories, but I couldn't get either to work reliably from work. Still though, Bitbucket are now offering the equivalent of Github's Small plan ($12/month) for free - interesting times.
