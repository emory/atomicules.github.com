<p>Piero Fiorani now has his own site up. Head over there for the <a href="http://web.mac.com/piero.fiorani/iWeb/PieroF%20FCE%20Effect/" >latest and greatest fxscripts for Final Cut Express</a>. Everything posted and hosted here shall remain for reference, but since I&apos;m no longer using FCE (sob, sob) and thus no longer working with fxscript I can&apos;t support or continue to develop anything I&apos;ve done. I shall leave everything in Piero&apos;s capable hands.</p>
