<p>I know I&apos;m <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/19/dive-into-xml.html">not supposed to serve XHTML1.1 as text/html</a>, but since this is hosted on <a href="http://www.mac.com">.mac</a> there is nothing I can do about it. Plus the W3 recommendation only says &quot;Should&quot; and I&apos;m not about to republish everything as XHTML1.0 . Also since I host my site locally on Apache I know that it doesn&apos;t break when served as application/xhtml+xml. I know because I&apos;ve checked. It looks exactly the same. Although I do wish I could configure my Apache to do this properly. The only way I can get it to do it is if I use the .xhtml extension. All the other hints, such as the mod_rewrite one linked above, give me errors. Must be something weird with Apache on OSX.</p>

<p>The other bonus (I guess) is that since .mac serves it as text/html it means IE users can see it.</p>

<p>So there you go, that's my excuse</p>
