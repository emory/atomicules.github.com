<p>I&apos;m addicted to tabbed browsing, be it <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> or <a href="http://chimera.mozdev.org/">Chimera</a> (Probably even <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> if I had it) I just can&apos;t seem to help opening every link I click on in a new tab.  It&apos;s not like tabbed browsing is new and I don&apos;t even think I realise I am doing this.  There is obviously no need for this behaviour, but for some reason I seem to feel I must not move forward from the page I&apos;m on (it&apos;s like I don&apos;t possess a <strong>back</strong> button), but instead must leave it intact incase there is a link I&apos;ve left unexplored.  I really must stop or get a widescreen monitor to fit all those tabs</p>
