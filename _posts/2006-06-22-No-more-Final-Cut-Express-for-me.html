title: No more Final Cut Express for me
categories: art
---
<p>I was hoping to make a post of this title this year when Apple mentioned their <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/universal/crossgrade/">amazing deal for going from Motion 2 to FCS</a>. However, it didn&apos;t quite work out as planned:</p>



<p>The fact that my machine has been out of action for editing (still no battery, still no internal hard drive or optical drive) for about 7 months and with no sign in site of me having the cash to mend it made me realise that video editing is a hobby I can&apos;t afford. So reluctantly I&apos;ve sold them both.</p>



<p>This of course means no more fxscript development by me, but I&apos;m sure Piero will handle whatever updates are required. Feel free to get in touch (contact) still and I can put you in touch with Piero or post a message at the <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/forum.jspa?forumID=936">Final Cut Express Apple Discussion forum</a> and I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll pick up on it there.</p>



<p>If I ever get my machine up and running, I&apos;m going to be looking into using <a href="http://www.jahshaka.org">Jahshaka</a>.</p>
