I often think about that phrase "All the gear, no idea" and turning in on its head for fixed gear cycling into something like "One Gear, All the ideas", but haven't yet been able to come up with anything that sounds good (as that obviously doesn't). However, perhaps that is because "One Gear" is more often than not a stupid idea (a fun one, but stupid all the same).

So, doing Land's End to John O'Groats on a singlespeed, as Simon Watkins is planning on doing, is either a stroke of genius (it'll be a lot of fun) or madness (his poor legs). Here's wishing him a tailwind all the way!
