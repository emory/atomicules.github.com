<p>I had a go at implementing a simple force directed graph layout algorithm in JavaScript.<br><a href="http://dhotson.github.com/springy.html">Try it out</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://dhotson.github.com/springy.html"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l0v8oqP8Ve1qz7e23.png" style="border: none;"></a></p> <p>So what does this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-based_algorithms">force directed</a> stuff mean anyway? Basically, it uses a physics simulation to figure out how to show the graph/network decently.</p> <p>In particular, it simulates a bunch of...</p></blockquote>

<p>At work, I've been doing a fair bit of Javascript - in the form of UserScripting for Chrome - to 'fix' bits of the intranet that are IE specific. I was starting to think I was getting quite clever...</p>
