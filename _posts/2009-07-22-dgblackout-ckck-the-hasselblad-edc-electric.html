<blockquote>The <b>Hasselblad EDC (Electric Data Camera)</b> was a specially designed camera intended for use on the surface of the moon, where the first lunar pictures were taken on July 20th, 1969 by Neil Armstrong... ...The 12 HEDC cameras used on the surface of the moon were left there. Only the film magazines were brought back.</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>So, first come, first served, a trip to the moon bags you a free Hassy? Probably cheaper than eBay!</p>
<p>There is some more info on the <a href="http://www.hasselblad.com/about-hasselblad/hasselblad-in-space/space-cameras.aspx">Hasselblad Space Cameras</a> page.</p>
