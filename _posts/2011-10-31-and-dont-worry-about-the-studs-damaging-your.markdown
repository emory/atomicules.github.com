<a href="http://peterwhitecycles.com/studdedtires.asp">Studded Bicycle Tires</a>

Had to swap to my winter tyres this weekend. Weather doesn't merit it yet, but my rear summer tyre was so worn it was bulging out in about eight different places. So I thought I might as well just put the winter ones on.

I hadn't bought new winter tyres as they still looked in reasonable nick from last year (they were new then). But lo and behold I get a puncture on the way to work. It turns out the casing is failing on the rear and the studs are coming through. 

One fucking season! I cycle far too many miles!

I can't afford a new one yet, so I'm just going to try lining it with the old summer tyre I've just taken off and see how that goes.
