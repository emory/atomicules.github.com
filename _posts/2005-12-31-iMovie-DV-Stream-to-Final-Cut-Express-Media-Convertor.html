<p>It&apos;s an Applescript droplet that you can drag the iMovie DV stream media files onto and it&apos;ll run away and convert them. There&apos;s also a standalone version of the script if you want to run it from the script menu on individual files, etc. It&apos;s a 0.9 release since for ease of development in Applescript it doesn't include any error handling, etc. Also I&apos;ve just realised it assumes 16 bit audio. Although I think you really should be working with this anyway. I&apos;ll sort this for a later version.</p>

<p>Related to this post on <a href="/art/2005/11/29/Importing-iMovie-Captures/">how to manually convert iMovie captured media from the DV Stream format to a FCE compatible one</a> and this thread, <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=213003">&quot;Importing Files Captured in iMovie HD&quot; on Apple Discussions</a> I&apos;ve figured out how to automate the process with Applescript. I thought it would be a lot harder than it turned out to be, hence why I&apos;ve only just got around to it. Next I&apos;ll have to figure out how to turn it into an Automator action. That would be cool and an excuse to look at Xcode. </p>
