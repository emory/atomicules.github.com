<p>A few more recent tweaks to get my inline images sorted. You&apos;ll probably not notice. Still not perfect, but I&apos;m happier now my images aren't sticking out of by blog posts. Not that there are many images; I really should start putting some more in. </p>

<p>Main things I had to do were to .byline (the bit at the bottom of my posts with my name and date) a block so clear it so it would always sit below any images. Of course, then I had to tweak the margins a bit (well, remove them). Any inline images are still simply floated left or right. Still a bit of an issue with images not floating completely cleanly depending on where in the source they occur. I don&apos; quite get it, but it's not a biggy</p>
