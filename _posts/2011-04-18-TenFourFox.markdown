On a PPC web browser note, came across this recently. I'm very grateful of developers like this (also [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/), [Itsy](http://mowglii.com/itsy/) and [Sparrow](http://sparrowmailapp.com/) spring to mind) who still support Leopard and PPC Macs. 

Camino-Webkit will be Intel only, and it looks like even anything [after Firefox 4 is going to be a struggle](http://tenfourfox.blogspot.com/2011/04/ruminations-on-mozilla-rapid-release.html) (the TenFourFox blog is an interesting read, by the way). But at least having FF4 available will keep PPC Macs going for quite awhile longer.

(Day to day I'm still using Camino, because it launches faster and is still prettier in my eyes, but it is comforting having TenFourFox available)
