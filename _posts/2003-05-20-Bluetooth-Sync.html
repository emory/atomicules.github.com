<p>On a plus point, I&apos;ve got my <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/usb/dbt120/index.htm">D-Link bluetooth adaptor</a> and can now do <a href="http://www.apple.com/bluetooth/">nifty things</a> with my phone via bluetooth and very nifty things with <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/jonassalling/Shareware/Clicker/">Salling Clicker</a>, an ace bit of software.  So if I wanted to I could start my mac playing music whilst in bed.  It&apos;s of no real use I guess, but terribly geeky and fun.

<p>It meant I could sync the address book on my computer with my phone and also with the one in my webmail account.  And I can also transfer images to my phone wirelessly.  Stoked.</p>
