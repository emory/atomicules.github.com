...due to my [unexpected](http://twitter.com/atomicules/status/13262677183) [Ubuntu](http://twitter.com/i5m/status/13262725543) [trial](http://twitter.com/atomicules/status/13377189047) at work.

* It's bloody good. Looks lovely. I'd quite happily use this full time if I had that choice/option (not like there's any competition with XP, but I mean I'd also switch from OSX for this; Was never a fan of the brown theme, preferring [Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/), but I prefer this new theme to Mint).
* Does multiple monitor support pretty much no problem. (The first time I set them up, laptop (1440x900) and monitor (1280x1024), I had a few glitches getting the settings to work: I had to apply the settings a few times and toggle between settings, etc until it worked ok. But subsequent times it worked first go. Bizarre.)
* You can [move the menus bars to the 'main' monitor](http://gaarai.com/2009/11/03/move-gnome-panels-to-a-different-monitor-in-ubuntu/).
* To get [Lastpass](http://www.lastpass.com) working, had to launch from terminal and be sure to export HTTPS_PROXY before hand
* Non-persistant LiveUSBs aren't that bad afterall: I used to use [Slax](http://www.slax.org) a fair bit, because it's small, looks good and I could have a persistant install on a 1GB usb stick (I don't have the min 2gb for a persitant Ubuntu install :-( ). But then I twigged, there's not that much downside to a LiveUSB install in cloud-computing land: I've just moved my Firefox profile onto another USB stick and I can reconnect to that each time I used the LiveUSB; tweaking other settings each time isn't so bad.
* Be VERY careful when installing to an external USB drive from the LiveUSB. The default settings will happily trounce the MBR of the internal drive. And although in [theory](http://community.mcafee.com/message/98075) this is [fixable](http://community.mcafee.com/message/4235), in mine it wasn't. Whole laptop had to be re-imaged. Ooops.
