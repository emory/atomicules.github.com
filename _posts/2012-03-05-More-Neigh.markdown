Another neigh picture, this one from the weekend. I tried to follow up with a picture of Mouse on Summer (the new arrival), but this one had jammed slightly in the camera and didn't come out cleanly. This must have prised the rollers open a bit as the next one came out far too easily and didn't actually develop. But, hey, at least after over a year of having ponies I finally have two pictures of one of them.

P.S: Where did February go?
