Oooh, so nearly a Firefox replacement for at work. It's not quite there yet: For instance to get themes to work, I had to keep Chrome installed, apply the theme there and copy over my preferences file to Chromeplus. Just a bit messy, and I don't really want to have Chrome and Chromeplus installed. So for now Firefox still wins. Good to see this though.
