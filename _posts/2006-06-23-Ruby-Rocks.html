<p>I&apos;m not really sure what first got me interested in Ruby. Probably just reading about Ruby on Rails somewhere. I know <a href="/code/2005/12/07/Image-Galleries/">I mentioned it here</a>.</p>



<p>What I do know its that I Love Ruby. It&apos;s great. It rocks my world.</p>



<p>Not being a programmer has certain advantages when it comes to programming. It means all languages are the same to me in that I just need to know that languages way of inputting and outputting, setting variables and doing some loops. It means I don&apos;t know how these things should be done. I don&apos;t know what is good or bad in a language. I don&apos;t really know or care what OOP is. I just know whats easy to use. And ruby is really easy to use (How&apos;s <em>if FileTest.exists?(filepath_pt)</em> for easy, you can almost guess the commands). Plus <a href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/">incredibly fun</a>.</p>



<p>I&apos;ve managed to write such incredibly beautiful programs as this:</p>

<p>OK it looks rubbish, but it works and it was very easy to do. Since only windows users here are likely to use it the looks aren&apos;t important - they are used to rubbish GUIs. RubyTk is very easy to use and has the benefit of being completely cross platform so I can easily do stuff at home as well.</p>



<p>I understand there are big arguements for and against certain languages, but I think this guy understands why Ruby is successful and taking off. It&apos;s because <a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/anti-anti-hype.html">it&apos;s cool</a>. I gather from reading that, as an engineer I should probably be using Python (although I say Octave for pure maths), but I&apos;m not the typical grey engineer (hence all my difficulties with engineering) so I find it amusing that ended up using Ruby without knowing any of that.</p>



<p>I&apos;m glad I&apos;ve managed to do something fun at work, that also has a legit use (searching millions and millions of lines of Ansys files). If only I could do that every day.</p>
