<blockquote>
<p>Merry Christmas, everyone! This year, I’ve got another present for you: Hackety Hack v1.0! You can get it on <a href="http://hackety-hack.com">version 2 of the Hackety Hack website</a>.</p> <p>It’s been a long, long road since the v0.9 release last year. Many people have put in a lot of hard work to bring Hackety Hack v1.0 to fruition....</p></blockquote>

<p>And there was me thinking it was hard work getting Turkey v1.0 and Goose v1.0 done in time for 3pm on Christmas Day.</p>
