Yay! It's time for [Roidweek](http://www.flickr.com/groups/polaroidweek2009/) again on Flickr. There are two Roidweeks a yeah and unfortunately it seems to be the only time I get to break out the Polaroid camera. I don't mean it to happen this way, it's just that film is so expensive I just never seem to squeeze anymore in inbetween.

Anyway, it's about as fun as photography can get and a good excuse to find something/anything to take a picture of everyday for a week - I'm not usually in to 'forced' shots, 365s, etc, so it's a bit of a challenge and something different.

This was a tester shot, always a relief that the camera is still working. [Not off to a wonderful start](http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/4069879348/in/photostream/) this time round. Hoping for better results tomorrow.
