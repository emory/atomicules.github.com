This looks really interesting. Nodal based GUI and workflow to using R. The only thing is, I couldn't get it working properly. I managed to read in an Excel file, but couldn't do a simple barplot. Tried the supplied Histogram widget, which showed a graph for a default column, but I couldn't get it to update for another column, etc. Tried a Generic Plot, but couldn't enter any data into the boxes. I'm guessing it's still very much under development. Back to [Rcmdr](http://rcommander.com/) it is.
