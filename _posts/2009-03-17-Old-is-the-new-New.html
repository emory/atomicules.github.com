<p>I was thinking this the other day, watching tv on our ancient Ferguson TX; which I can&#39;t figure out how old it is, but it must be somewhere between 20-30 years old and it is still working well enough that there is absolutely NO WAY I&#39;m replacing it before it dies - it&#39;s outlived many more recent offerings, I&#39;m sure. But without realising it, old has become the new new for me.</p><p>My cameras, being second hand film cameras, are all old. The oldest must be my Great Grandpa&#39;s No.2A Folding Autographic Brownie from 1926, the newest being the Canon Ixus L-1 from 1997. And then there&#39;s the rest everywhere in between. And they are all lovely. I wouldn&#39;t swop my Yashica Mat for a Nikon D300 (or whatever is good at the mo&#39;) because it&#39;s just not the same thing.</p><p>My computer is old by computer standards: 2003. Six years isn&#39;t bad going. Fingers crossed it keeps going longer. It&#39;s old technology as it&#39;s a PPC processor. Part of the enjoyment is/has been using sometime different. But with a new machine there&#39;s either x86 or x86. It will very soon be &#34;obsolete&#34; in that it won&#39;t be able to run the latest OS. But it won&#39;t be obsolete in that it will still do what I need it to do.</p><p>As technology progresses it seems to converge and refine whereas with old technology there&#39;s a lot more diversity. Which to me translates as more things to try out. And not all of it is past its sell by date. It still does the trick.</p><p>I&#39;m not anti-new technology. Far from it, but being into new technology does come at a cost (Mind you, being into old technology can come at a cost as well, especially with some cameras!)</p><p>The only downside is being left behind. But you don&#39;t have to stay behind permanently, just lag a little.</p>
