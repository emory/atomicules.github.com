It's good to see Gecko pulling some punches at Webkit (I love Webkit, but I _don't_ want it to become the only rendering engine. Webkit, at least Chrome developer build, doesn't render the MathML properly from [the inline MathML and SVG example](http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/moz/html5-hacks-demo.html), and the SVG not at all).
